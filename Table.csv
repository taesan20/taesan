"Number of domestic households are rounded to the nearest hundred.Figures in the table may not add up to the total due to rounding.For annual estimates less than 1 000 and quarterly estimates less than 3 000, they should be interpreted with caution due to relatively large sampling error.Starting from 2001, annual figures are compiled based on data collected in the General Household Survey from January to December of the year concerned as well as the mid-year population estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1 Household size refers to the number of household members in a domestic household.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Domestic household consists of a group of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. Households comprising only non-Hong Kong residents or Mobile Residents are not classified as domestic households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
